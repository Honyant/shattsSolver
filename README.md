# Shatters Puzzle Solver

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I saw a video of someone struggling with the Shatters Puzzle in ROTMG, so I decided to make a program to solve it. The puzzle itself is a 3 by 3 lights out puzzle, so I just threw together a quick program to solve it, and spent some time making it look pretty nice and to learn React.

## Features
- Solves the puzzle for 1 by 1 up to 4 by 4 puzzles (terrible time complexity, but it works)
- Shows the solution as an orange border around the tiles that need to be toggled (this can be disabled)
- Starts in single toggle mode, but can be switched to toggle like the actual game
